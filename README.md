# Basic Sequential Model Using Keras API
This model is a basic demonstration of how to use a Sequential model to create and train an artificial neural network utilizing the Keras API in Tensorflow. This is very basic data, so basic that a neural network is probably not needed, but rather serves as a demonstration of the architecture of a Sequential with 3 dense layers. 
The motivation behind the data is that a certain drug is given to patients ages 13 to 100. 5% of patients 13-64 experience side effects, whereas 95% of patients 65-100 experience side effects.
